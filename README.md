Goal to achieve : 
1. Develop a struct that can store an atomic element
2. create from input at the terminal the first ten elements in the periodic table as a linked list with this struct as data. print out this information to the screen in a nicely readable form. The struct should have three membersâ€”one stores the name of the element, a second stores it atomic symbol, and a third stores its weight.
